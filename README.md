# Playliststore

WIP Golang tool for creating a db of playlists and songs from Spotify. Should run on a daily cronjob.


## Aims

* Keep track of generated playlist history. Sometimes I forget to like a song on Discover Weekly 
* Get metrics on Blend playlists. How often do songs re-enter the playlist? Which songs stay around the longest?

## TODO
* Get better at Go 
* Everything else
